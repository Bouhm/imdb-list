## Running the App

This app compares the rendering performance between a React class-based app and a hooks app. The two different implementations are in `src/classes` and `src/hooks` respectively, and can be run simultaneously.

### Classes Implementation

Use `npm run classes:start`

### Hooks Implementation

Use `npm run hooks:start`
