## Running the App

This app compares the rendering performance between a React class-based app and a hooks app. The two different implementations are in `class-src` and `hooks-src` respectively, and can be run separately.

### Classes Implementation

Use `npm run classes:start`

### Hooks Implementation

Use `npm run hooks:start`
